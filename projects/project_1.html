      <h2>About NAGS</h2>
      <p>The National Antimicrobial Guidelines (NAGS) provide evidence-based recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents to combat infections and reduce antimicrobial resistance. </p>
      <p>These guidelines are designed to support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about antimicrobial therapy.</p>
